                            <h2> What is Cancer</h2>
                                <p> Cancer is a disease in which some of the bodyâ€™s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. 
                                Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. </p> 
                            </p>Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs them. 
                                When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. </p>

                                <p> Choose positive, hopeful words, but don't give people false hope or talk about other people's cancer outcomes.
                                    Remember, each person is different, and hearing other people's stories may scare your friend or loved one.
